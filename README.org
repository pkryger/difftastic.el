** Description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: description
:END:
The =difftastic= Emacs package is designed to integrate
[[https://github.com/wilfred/difftastic][difftastic]] - a structural diff
tool - into your Emacs workflow, enhancing your code review and comparison
experience.  This package automatically displays =difftastic='s output within
Emacs using faces from your user theme, ensuring consistency with your overall
coding environment.

** Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: features
:END:
- Configure faces to your likening.  By default =magit-diff-*= faces from your
  user them are used for consistent visual experience.
- Chunks and file navigation using ~n~ / ~N~ and ~p~ / ~P~ in generated diffs.
- DWIM workflows from =magit=.
- Rerun =difftastic= with ~g~ to use current window width to "reflow" content
  and/or to force language change (when called with prefix).

** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:
*** Installing from MELPA
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-from-melpa
:END:
The easiest way to install and keep =difftastic= up-to-date is using Emacs'
built-in package manager.  =difftastic= is available in the MELPA
repository.  Refer to https://melpa.org/#/getting-started for how to install a
package from MELPA.

Please see [[#configuration][Configuration]] section for example configuration.

You can use any of the package managers that supports installation from MELPA.
It can be one of (but not limited to): one of the built-in =package=,
=use-package=, or any other package manger that handles autoloads generation,
for example (in alphabetical order)
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]],
[[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][Elpaca]],
[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][Quelpa]], or
[[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]].


*** Installing from GitHub
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-from-github
:END:
The preferred method is to use built-in =use-package=.  Add the following to
your Emacs configuration file (usually =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package difftastic
  :defer t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el.git"
       :rev :newest)))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can do a manual checkout and install it from there, for
example:

1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, for example
   =~/src/difftastic=.
2. Add the following lines to your Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package difftastic
  :defer t
  :vc t
  :load-path "~/src/difftastic")
#+end_src

Yet another option is to use any of the package managers that supports
installation from GitHub or a an existing checkout.  That could be
=package-vc=, or any of package managers listed in
[[#installing-from-melpa][Installing from MELPA]].

**** Manual installation
Note, that this method does not generate autoloads.  As a consequence it will
cause the whole package and it's dependencies (including =magit=) to be loaded
at startup.  If you want to avoid this, ensure autoloads set up on Emacs
startup.  See [[#installing-from-melpa][Installing from MELPA]] a few package
managers that can generate autoloads when package is installed.

1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, for example
   =~/src/difftastic=.
2. Add the following line to your Emacs configuration file:

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/difftastic")
(require 'difftastic)
(require 'difftastic-bindings)
 #+end_src

** Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: configuration
:END:
This section assumes you have =difftastic='s autoloads set up at Emacs startup.
If you have installed =difftastic= using built-in =package= or =use-package=
then you should be all set.

To configure =difftastic= commands in relevant =magit= prefixes and keymaps,
use the following code snippet in your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(difftastic-bindings-mode)
#+end_src

Or, if you use =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package difftastic-bindings
  :ensure difftastic ;; or nil if you prefer manual installation
  :config (difftastic-bindings-mode))
#+end_src

This will bind ~D~ to =difftastic-magit-diff= and ~S~ to
=difftastic-magit-show= in =magit-diff= and =magit-blame= transient prefixes as
well as in =magit-blame-read-only-map=.  Please refer to =difftastic-bindings=
documentation to see how to change default bindings.

You can adjust what bindings you want to have configured by changing values of
=difftastic-bindings-alist=, =difftastic-bindings-prefixes=, and
=difftastic-bindings-keymaps=.  You need to turn the =difftastic-bindings-mode=
off and on again to apply the changes.

The =difftastic-bindings=mode= was designed to have minimal dependencies and be
reasonably fast to load, while providing a mechanism to bind =difftastic=
commands, such that they are available in relevant contexts.

*** Manual Key Bindings Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: manual_key_Bindings_configuration
:END:

If you don't want to use mechanism delivered by =difftastic-bindings-mode= you
can write your own configuration.  As a starting point the following snippets
demonstrate how to achieve roughly the same effect as
=difftastic-bindings-mode=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(require 'difftastic)
(require 'transient)

(let ((suffix [("D" "Difftastic diff (dwim)" difftastic-magit-diff)
               ("S" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)]))
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit-diff
    (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-diff suffix)
                   (transient-get-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1)))
      (transient-append-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1) suffix)))
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit-blame
    (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-blame suffix)
                   (transient-get-suffix 'magit-blame '(-1)))
      (transient-append-suffix 'magit-blame '(-1) suffix))
    (keymap-set magit-blame-read-only-mode-map
                "D" #'difftastic-magit-show)
    (keymap-set magit-blame-read-only-mode-map
                "S" #'difftastic-magit-show)))
#+end_src

Or, if you use =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package difftastic
  :defer t
  :init
  (use-package transient               ; to silence compiler warnings
    :autoload (transient-get-suffix
               transient-parse-suffix))

  (let ((suffix [("D" "Difftastic diff (dwim)" difftastic-magit-diff)
                 ("S" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)]))
    (use-package magit-blame
      :defer t :ensure magit
      :bind
      (:map magit-blame-read-only-mode-map
            ("D" . #'difftastic-magit-diff)
            ("S" . #'difftastic-magit-show))
      :config
      (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-blame suffix)
                     (transient-get-suffix 'magit-blame '(-1)))
        (transient-append-suffix 'magit-blame '(-1) suffix)))
    (use-package magit-diff
      :defer t :ensure magit
      :config
      (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-diff suffix)
                     (transient-get-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1)))
        (transient-append-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1) suffix)))))
#+end_src

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:
The following commands are meant to help to interact with =difftastic=.
Commands are followed by their default keybindings in =difftastic-mode= (in
parenthesis).

- =difftastic-magit-diff= - show the result of =git diff ARGS -- FILES= with
  =difftastic=.  This is the main entry point for DWIM action, so it tries to
  guess revision or range.
- =difftastic-magit-show= - show the result of =git show ARG= with
  =difftastic=.  It tries to guess =ARG=, and ask for it when can't. When
  called with prefix argument it will ask for =ARG=.
- =difftastic-files= - show the result of =difft FILE-A FILE-B=.  When called
  with prefix argument it will ask for language to use, instead of relaying on
  =difftastic='s detection mechanism.
- =difftastic-buffers= - show the result of =difft BUFFER-A BUFFER-B=.
  Language is guessed based on buffers modes.  When called with prefix argument
  it will ask for language to use.
- =difftastic-dired-diff= - same as =dired-diff=, but with =difftastic-files=
  instead of the built-in =diff=.
- =difftastic-rerun= (~g~) - rerun difftastic for the current buffer.  It runs
  difftastic again in the current buffer, but respects the window
  configuration.  It uses =difftastic-rerun-requested-window-width-function=
  which, by default, returns current window width (instead of
  =difftastic-requested-window-width-function=).  It will also reuse current
  buffer and will not call =difftastic-display-buffer-function=.  When called
  with prefix argument it will ask for language to use.
- =difftastic-next-chunk= (~n~), =difftastic-next-file= (~N~) - move point to a
  next logical chunk or a next file respectively.
- =difftastic-previous-chunk= (~p~), =difftastic-previous-file= (~P~) - move
  point to a previous logical chunk or a previous file respectively.
- =difftastic-toggle-chunk= (~TAB~ or ~C-i~) - toggle visibility of a chunk at
  point.  The point has to be in a chunk header.  When called with a prefix all
  file chunks from the header to the end of the file.  See also
  =difftastic-hide-chunk= and =difftastic=show-chunk=.
- =difftastic-diff-visit-file= (~RET~),
  =difftastic-diff-visit-file-other-window=,
  =difftastic-diff-visit-file-other-frame= - from a diff visit appropriate
  version of a chunk file.  This has been modeled after
  =magit-diff-visit-file=, but there are some differences, please see
  documentation for =difftastic-diff-visit-file=.
- =difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file= (~C-RET~, ~C-j~),
  =difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-window=,
  =difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-frame= - from a diff visit
  appropriate version of a chunk file.  This has been modeled after
  =magit-diff-visit-worktree-file=, but there are some differences, please see
  documentation for =difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file=.
- =difftastic-git-diff-range= - transform =ARGS= for difftastic and show the
  result of =git diff ARGS REV-OR-RANGE -- FILES= with =difftastic=.

** Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customization
:END:
*** Face Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: face-customization
:END:
You can customize the appearance of =difftastic= output by adjusting the faces
used for highlighting.  To customize a faces, use the following code snippet in
your configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
;; Customize faces used to display difftastic output.
(setq difftastic-normal-colors-vector
  (vector
   ;; use black face from `ansi-color'
   (aref ansi-color-normal-colors-vector 0)
   ;; use face for removed marker from `difftastic'
   (aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 1)
   ;; use face for added marker from `difftastic'
   (aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 2)
   'my-section-face
   'my-comment-face
   'my-string-face
   'my-warning-face
   ;; use white face from `ansi-color'
   (aref ansi-color-normal-colors-vector 7)))

;; Customize highlight faces
(setq difftastic-highlight-alist
  `((,(aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 2) . my-added-highlight)
    (,(aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 1) . my-removed-highlight)))

;; Disable highlight faces (use difftastic's default)
(setq difftastic-highlight-alist nil)
#+end_src

*** Window management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: window-management
:END:
The =difftastic= relies on the =difft= command line tool to produce an output
that can be displayed in an Emacs buffer window.  In short: it runs the
=difft=, converts ANSI codes into user defined colors and displays it in
window.  The =difft= can be instructed with a hint to help it produce a content
that can fit into user output, by specifying a requested width.  However, the
latter is not always respected.

The =difftastic= provides a few variables to let you customize these aspects of
interaction with =difft=:
- =difftastic-requested-window-width-function= - this function is called for a
  first (i.e., not a rerun) call to =difft=.  It shall return the requested
  width of the output.  For example this can be a half of a current frame (or a
  window) if the output is meant to be presented side by side.
- =difftastic-rerun-requested-window-width-function= - this function is called
  for a rerun (i.e., not a first) call to =difft=.  It shall return requested
  window width of the output.  For example this can be a current window width if
  the output is meant to fill the whole window.
- =difftastic-display-buffer-function= - this function is called after a first
  call to =difft=.  It is meant to select an appropriate Emacs mechanism to
  display the =difft= output.

*** =difftastic-mode= behavior
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: difftastic-mode-behavior
:END:
- =difftastic-diff-visit-avoid-head-blob= - controls whether to avoid visiting
  blob of a =HEAD= revision when visiting file form a =difftastic-mode= buffer.

This package was inspired by the need for an integration of =difftastic= within
Emacs, enhancing the code review process for developers.

This work is based on Tassilo Horn's
[[https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html][blog
entry]].

=magit-diff= keybindings and a concept of updating faces comes from a Shiv
Jha-Mathur's [[https://shivjm.blog/better-magit-diffs/][blog entry]].

This all has been strongly influenced by - a class in itself -
[[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] and
[[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] Emacs packages by Jonas
Bernoulli.

*** Diff ANSI
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: diff-ansi
:END:
There's a [[https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-diff-ansi][diff-ansi]]
package available.  I haven't spent much time on it, but at a first glance it
doesn't seem that it supports =difftastic= out of box.  Perhaps it is possible
to configure it to support =difftastic= as a custom tool.
