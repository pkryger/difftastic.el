;; Description
;; ===========
;;
;; The `difftastic' Emacs package is designed to integrate [difftastic] - a
;; structural diff tool - into your Emacs workflow, enhancing your code review
;; and comparison experience.  This package automatically displays
;; `difftastic''s output within Emacs using faces from your user theme,
;; ensuring consistency with your overall coding environment.
;;
;;
;; [difftastic] <https://github.com/wilfred/difftastic>
;;
;;
;; Features
;; ========
;;
;; - Configure faces to your likening.  By default `magit-diff-*' faces from
;;   your user them are used for consistent visual experience.
;; - Chunks and file navigation using `n' / `N' (or `M-n') and `p' / `P' (or
;;   `M-p'), as well as `C-M-f', `C-M-b', and `C-M-SPC' in generated diffs.
;; - Hide chunks and files with `TAB' when on a chunk/file header.  Use `C-u
;;   TAB' to hide whole file.
;; - DWIM workflows from `magit'.
;; - Use difftastic do compare files and buffers (also directly from `dired').
;; - Rerun `difftastic' with `g' to use current window width to "reflow"
;;   content and/or to force language change (when called with prefix).
;; - Use double prefix argument to specify all `difftastic' arguments.
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; Installing from MELPA
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; The easiest way to install and keep `difftastic' up-to-date is using Emacs'
;; built-in package manager.  `difftastic' is available in the MELPA
;; repository.  Refer to <https://melpa.org/#/getting-started> for how to
;; install a package from MELPA.
;;
;; Please see [Configuration] section for example configuration.
;;
;; You can use any of the package managers that supports installation from
;; MELPA.  It can be one of (but not limited to): one of the built-in
;; `package', `use-package', or any other package manger that handles
;; autoloads generation, for example (in alphabetical order) [Borg], [Elpaca],
;; [Quelpa], or [straight.el].
;;
;;
;; [Configuration] See section Configuration
;;
;; [Borg] <https://github.com/emacscollective/borg>
;;
;; [Elpaca] <https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca>
;;
;; [Quelpa] <https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa>
;;
;; [straight.el] <https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el>
;;
;;
;; Installing from GitHub
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; The preferred method is to use built-in `use-package'.  Add the following
;; to your Emacs configuration file (usually `~/.emacs' or
;; `~/.emacs.d/init.el'):
;;
;; (use-package difftastic
;;   :defer t
;;   :vc (:url "https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el.git"
;;        :rev :newest)))
;;
;; Alternatively, you can do a manual checkout and install it from there, for
;; example:
;;
;; 1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, for example
;;    `~/src/difftastic'.
;; 2. Add the following lines to your Emacs configuration file:
;;
;; (use-package difftastic
;;   :defer t
;;   :vc t
;;   :load-path "~/src/difftastic")
;;
;; Yet another option is to use any of the package managers that supports
;; installation from GitHub or a an existing checkout.  That could be
;; `package-vc', or any of package managers listed in [Installing from MELPA].
;;
;;
;; [Installing from MELPA] See section Installing from MELPA
;;
;; Manual Installation
;; -------------------
;;
;; Note, that this method does not generate autoloads.  As a consequence it
;; will cause the whole package and it's dependencies (including `magit') to
;; be loaded at startup.  If you want to avoid this, ensure autoloads set up
;; on Emacs startup.  See [Installing from MELPA] a few package managers that
;; can generate autoloads when package is installed.
;;
;; 1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, for example
;;    `~/src/difftastic'.
;; 2. Add the following line to your Emacs configuration file:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/difftastic")
;;    (require 'difftastic)
;;    (require 'difftastic-bindings)
;;
;;
;; [Installing from MELPA] See section Installing from MELPA
;;
;;
;; Configuration
;; =============
;;
;; This section assumes you have `difftastic''s autoloads set up at Emacs
;; startup.  If you have installed `difftastic' using built-in `package' or
;; `use-package' then you should be all set.
;;
;; To configure `difftastic' commands in relevant `magit' prefixes and
;; keymaps, use the following code snippet in your Emacs configuration:
;;
;; (difftastic-bindings-mode)
;;
;; Or, if you use `use-package':
;;
;; (use-package difftastic-bindings
;;   :ensure difftastic ;; or nil if you prefer manual installation
;;   :config (difftastic-bindings-mode))
;;
;; By default this will bind:
;; - `M-d' to `difftastic-magit-diff' and `M-c' to `difftastic-magit-show' in
;;   `magit-diff' prefix,
;; - `M-RET' to `difftastic-magit-show' in `magit-blame' transient prefix and
;;   in `magit-blame-read-only-map' keymap,
;; - `M-d' to `difftastic-magit-diff-buffer-file' in `magit-file-dispatch'
;;   prefix,
;; - `M-\=' to `difftastic-dired-diff' in `dired-mode-map'.
;;
;; Please refer to `difftastic-bindings-alist' documentation to see how to
;; change default bindings.  You need to toggle the `difftastic-bindings-mode'
;; off and on again to apply the changes.
;;
;; The `difftastic-bindings=mode' was designed to have minimal dependencies
;; and be reasonably fast to load, while providing a mechanism to bind
;; `difftastic' commands, such that they are available in relevant contexts.
;;
;;
;; Manual Key Bindings Configuration
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; If you don't want to use mechanism delivered by `difftastic-bindings-mode'
;; you can write your own configuration.  As a starting point the following
;; snippets demonstrate how to achieve partial effect similar to the one
;; provided by `difftastic-bindings-mode' in default configuration:
;;
;; (require 'difftastic)
;; (require 'transient)
;;
;; (let ((suffix [("D" "Difftastic diff (dwim)" difftastic-magit-diff)
;;                ("S" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)]))
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'magit-diff
;;     (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-diff suffix)
;;                    (transient-get-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1)))
;;       (transient-append-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1) suffix))))
;; (let ((suffix '("M-RET" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)))
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'magit-blame
;;     (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-blame suffix)
;;                    (transient-get-suffix 'magit-blame "b"))
;;       (transient-append-suffix 'magit-blame "b" suffix))
;;     (keymap-set magit-blame-read-only-mode-map
;;                 "M-RET" #'difftastic-magit-show)))
;;
;; Or, if you use `use-package':
;;
;; (use-package difftastic
;;   :defer t
;;   :init
;;   (use-package transient               ; to silence compiler warnings
;;     :autoload (transient-get-suffix
;;                transient-parse-suffix))
;;
;;     (use-package magit-blame
;;       :defer t :ensure magit
;;       :bind
;;       (:map magit-blame-read-only-mode-map
;;             ("M-RET" . #'difftastic-magit-show))
;;       :config
;;       (let ((suffix '("M-RET" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)))
;;         (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-blame suffix)
;;                        (transient-get-suffix 'magit-blame "b"))
;;           (transient-append-suffix 'magit-blame "b" suffix)))
;;     (use-package magit-diff
;;       :defer t :ensure magit
;;       :config
;;       (let ((suffix [("M-d" "Difftastic diff (dwim)" difftastic-magit-diff)
;;                      ("M-c" "Difftastic show" difftastic-magit-show)]))
;;         (unless (equal (transient-parse-suffix 'magit-diff suffix)
;;                        (transient-get-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1)))
;;           (transient-append-suffix 'magit-diff '(-1 -1) suffix)))))
;;
;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; General Usage
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; The following commands are meant to help invoking `difftastic' depending on
;; context and desired outcome.
;;
;; - `difftastic-magit-diff' - show the result of `git diff ARGS -- FILES'
;;   with `difftastic'.  This is the main entry point for DWIM action, so it
;;   tries to guess revision or range.
;; - `difftastic-magit-show' - show the result of `git show ARG' with
;;   `difftastic'.  It tries to guess `ARG', and ask for it when can't. When
;;   called with prefix argument it will ask for `ARG'.
;; - `difftastic-magit-diff-buffer-file' - show diff for the blob or file
;;   visited in the current buffer with `difftastic'.  When the buffer visits
;;   a blob, then show the respective commit.  When the buffer visits a file,
;;   then show the differences between `HEAD' and the working tree.
;; - `difftastic-files' - show the result of `difft FILE-A FILE-B'.  When
;;   called with prefix argument it will ask for language to use, instead of
;;   relaying on `difftastic''s detection mechanism.
;; - `difftastic-buffers' - show the result of `difft BUFFER-A BUFFER-B'.
;;   Language is guessed based on buffers modes.  When called with prefix
;;   argument it will ask for language to use.
;; - `difftastic-dired-diff' - same as `dired-diff', but with
;;   `difftastic-files' instead of the built-in `diff'.
;; - `difftastic-git-diff-range' - transform `ARGS' for difftastic and show
;;   the result of `git diff ARGS REV-OR-RANGE -- FILES' with `difftastic'.
;;
;;
;; Specifying `difftastic' Arguments
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; All [above] commands (and `difftastic-rerun' described [below]) support
;; specification of `difft' arguments.  When a command is called with a double
;; prefix argument a popup is presented allowing to specify desired arguments.
;; This is in addition to a command specific handling of a single prefix
;; argument.
;;
;; In order to aid arguments entry and provide similarity to workflows in
;; `magit' and `forge', a `transient' prefix is used for the popup.  For
;; example, some - less commonly used - arguments are not visible in default
;; configuration.  Type `C-x l' in the menu to make them visible.  Type `C-h
;; C-h' for `difftastic' help (`man difft').  Any other `transient' commands
;; should work as well.
;;
;; Note that in some cases arguments will take precedence over standard and
;; computed values, for example `--width' is one such a argument.
;;
;;
;; [above] See section General Usage
;;
;; [below] See section `difftastic-mode' Commands
;;
;;
;; `difftastic-mode' Commands
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; When a buffer shows `difftastic' output the following commands can be used.
;; Commands are followed by their default keybindings (in parenthesis).
;;
;; - `difftastic-rerun' (`g') - rerun difftastic for the current buffer.  It
;;   runs difftastic again in the current buffer, but respects the window
;;   configuration.  It uses
;;   `difftastic-rerun-requested-window-width-function' which, by default,
;;   returns current window width (instead of
;;   `difftastic-requested-window-width-function').  It will also reuse
;;   current buffer and will not call `difftastic-display-buffer-function'.
;;   When called with prefix argument it will ask for language to use.
;; - `difftastic-next-chunk' (`n'), `difftastic-next-file' (`N' or `M-n') -
;;   move point to a next logical chunk or a next file respectively.
;; - `difftastic-previous-chunk' (`p'), `difftastic-previous-file' (`P' or
;;   `M-p') - move point to a previous logical chunk or a previous file
;;   respectively.
;; - `difftastic-toggle-chunk' (`TAB' or `C-i') - toggle visibility of a chunk
;;   at point.  The point has to be in a chunk header.  When called with a
;;   prefix toggle all file chunks from the header to the end of the file.
;;   See also `difftastic-hide-chunk' and `difftastic=show-chunk'.
;; - `forward-sexp' (`C-M-f') - move point to end of current chunk or to an
;;   end of next chunk when point is already at the end of the chunk.  When
;;   called with argument move by that many chunks.  Binding is from a default
;;   `global-map'.
;; - `backward-sexp' (`C-M-b') - move point to beginning of current chunk or
;;   to a beginning of previous chunk when point is already at the beginning
;;   of the chunk.  When called with argument move by that many chunks.
;;   Binding is from a default `global-map'.
;; - `mark-sexp' (`C-M-SPC') - set mark and move point to end of current chunk
;;   or to an end of next chunk when point is already at the end of the chunk.
;;   When called with argument move by that many chunks.  Binding is from a
;;   default `global-map'.
;; - `difftastic-diff-visit-file' (`RET'),
;;   `difftastic-diff-visit-file-other-window',
;;   `difftastic-diff-visit-file-other-frame' - from a diff visit appropriate
;;   version of a chunk file.  This has been modeled after
;;   `magit-diff-visit-file', but there are some differences, please see
;;   documentation for `difftastic-diff-visit-file'.
;; - `difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file' (`C-RET', `C-j'),
;;   `difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-window',
;;   `difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file-other-frame' - from a diff visit
;;   appropriate version of a chunk file.  This has been modeled after
;;   `magit-diff-visit-worktree-file', but there are some differences, please
;;   see documentation for `difftastic-diff-visit-worktree-file'.
;;
;;
;; Customization
;; =============
;;
;; Face Customization
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; You can customize the appearance of `difftastic' output by adjusting the
;; faces used for highlighting.  To customize a faces, use the following code
;; snippet in your configuration:
;;
;; ;; Customize faces used to display difftastic output.
;; (setq difftastic-normal-colors-vector
;;   (vector
;;    ;; use black face from `ansi-color'
;;    (aref ansi-color-normal-colors-vector 0)
;;    ;; use face for removed marker from `difftastic'
;;    (aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 1)
;;    ;; use face for added marker from `difftastic'
;;    (aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 2)
;;    'my-section-face
;;    'my-comment-face
;;    'my-string-face
;;    'my-warning-face
;;    ;; use white face from `ansi-color'
;;    (aref ansi-color-normal-colors-vector 7)))
;;
;; ;; Customize highlight faces
;; (setq difftastic-highlight-alist
;;   `((,(aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 2) . my-added-highlight)
;;     (,(aref difftastic-normal-colors-vector 1) . my-removed-highlight)))
;;
;; ;; Disable highlight faces (use difftastic's default)
;; (setq difftastic-highlight-alist nil)
;;
;;
;; Window Management
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; The `difftastic' relies on the `difft' command line tool to produce an
;; output that can be displayed in an Emacs buffer window.  In short: it runs
;; the `difft', converts ANSI codes into user defined colors and displays it
;; in window.  The `difft' can be instructed with a hint to help it produce a
;; content that can fit into user output, by specifying a requested width.
;; However, the latter is not always respected.
;;
;; The `difftastic' provides a few variables to let you customize these
;; aspects of interaction with `difft':
;; - `difftastic-requested-window-width-function' - this function is called
;;   for a first (i.e., not a rerun) call to `difft'.  It shall return the
;;   requested width of the output.  For example this can be a half of a
;;   current frame (or a window) if the output is meant to be presented side
;;   by side.
;; - `difftastic-rerun-requested-window-width-function' - this function is
;;   called for a rerun (i.e., not a first) call to `difft'.  It shall return
;;   requested window width of the output.  For example this can be a current
;;   window width if the output is meant to fill the whole window.
;; - `difftastic-display-buffer-function' - this function is called after a
;;   first call to `difft'.  It is meant to select an appropriate Emacs
;;   mechanism to display the `difft' output.
;;
;;
;; `difftastic-mode' Behavior
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; - `difftastic-visibility-indicator' - controls whether and how to show
;;   hidden/visible chunk/files.
;; - `difftastic-diff-visit-avoid-head-blob' - controls whether to avoid
;;   visiting blob of a `HEAD' revision when visiting file form a
;;   `difftastic-mode' buffer.

;;
;; Testing
;; ~~~~~~~
;;
;; When creating a pull request make sure all tests in
;; <file:test/difftastic.t.el> are passing.  When adding a new functionality,
;; please strive to add tests for it as well.
;;
;; To run tests interactively:
;; - open the <file:test/difftastic.t.el>
;; - type `M-x eval-buffer <RET>'
;; - open the <file:test/difftastic-bindings.t.el>
;; - type `M-x eval-buffer <RET>'
;; - type `M-x ert <RET> t <RET>'
;;
;; Alternatively you can use [Cask] to run tests in batch mode.  There's a
;; convenience <file:Makefile> with a `test' target, so you can just type
;; `make test'.
;;
;; It seems that byte compilation interferres with [el-mock].  In order to get
;; the tests to pass you may need to:
;; - type `M-x eval-buffer <RET>' in <file:difftastic.el> and in
;;   <file:difftastic-bindings.el> when running test interactively with `M-x
;;   <RET> ert <RET>',
;; - remove all `.elc' files in the development directory when running tests
;;   in batch mode.
;;
;; This repository uses [Coveralls] to track test coverage.  After a PR has
;; been approved for a Gighub Action run, a report will be published
;; [Coveralls difftastic repo].  Please check it out if there's no outstanding
;; relevant lines.
;;
;; You can run all checks performed by Github Actions, by typing: `make
;; bytecompile lint relint checkdoc commentary test'.

       ii.  if point is at second number (\"right\") or in diff
            content then visit second file or second buffer.

2. If the diff shows uncommitted changes (i.e., staged or unstaged
   changes), and point is in the \"right\" column (or at \"right\" line
   number) or `difftastic-diff-visit-avoid-head-blob' is non-nil then
   visit file in the working tree (i.e., the same \"real\" file that
   `find-file' would visit).

3. In all other cases visit a \"blob\" (i.e., the version of a file as
   stored in some commit).
   a.  If the diff is a side-by-side diff (two columns) then:
       i.   if point is in \"left\" column then visit blob at
            \"from\" endpoint,
       ii.  if point is in \"right\" column then visit blob at
            \"to\" endpoint.
   b.  If the diff is a single column diff then:
       i.   if point is at first line number (\"left\") then visit
            blob at \"from\" endpoint,
       ii.  if point is at second number (\"right\") or in the diff
            content then visit the blob \"to\" endpoint.

In the file-visiting buffer also go to the line that corresponds to the
line that point is on in the diff.

Display the buffer in the selected window.  With a prefix argument
OTHER-WINDOW display the buffer in another window instead.

After visiting the FILE start a smerge session (if there are unmerged
changes) and run `difftastic-diff-visit-file-hook'.

The CHUNK-FILE is a list in a form of (FILE LINE-NUM COL SIDE), where
