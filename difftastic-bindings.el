form (TYPE . SPEC).  The TYPE is either `prefixes' or `keymaps' and:

- When TYPE is `prefixes' then SPEC is a list where each element is in a
  from of (PREFIX LOC FEATURE), where PREFIX is a `transient' prefix to
  which to install bindings, LOC is a location within the prefix and
  FEATURE is a feature (symbol) or file (string) that defines the
  prefix.  When length of SPEC is equal to 1 the binding is installed a
  transient suffix, otherwise it's installed as a transient column.  LOC
  can be in any form accepted by `transient-get-suffix', which see.

- When TYPE is `keymaps' then SPEC is a list where each element is in a
  form of (MAP . FEATURE), where MAP is a keymap to set bindings to and
  FEATURE is a feature (symbol) or file (string) that defines the MAP.

BINDINGS is a list where each enlement is in a form of (KEY COMMAND
DESCRIPTION), where KEY is a key that should be bound, COMMAND is a
command that should be executed when KEY has been pressed, and
DESCRIPTION is a description that should be used for suffixes that are
added to prefixes.  KEY needs to be a valid key according to
`key-valid-p' and in a form accepted by `transient-append-suffix'.
